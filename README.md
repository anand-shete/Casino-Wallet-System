# Casino Wallet System

A simulated crypto casino backend supporting BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Handles user registration, wallet management, and game logic using fake wallets and mock transactionsâ€”ideal for testing or educational purposes without real blockchain integration.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication** : Register users and store credentials securely using hashed passwords.
- **Fake Wallet Assignment** : Each user is assigned unique fake wallet addresses for BTC, ETH, SOL and DOGE.
- **Deposit Simulation** : Users can simulate depositing crypto in their wallet using their wallet addresses.
- **Withdrawl Simulation** : Real-time tracking of balances for each cryptocurrency per user.
- **Casino Game** : A simple game mechanic randomly returns "won" or "lost".
- **Vitest** : Used Vitest for efficient testing of all the backend endpoints.

   JWT_SECRET = your_JWT_SECRET
   ```

4. Start the `server.js` and `frontend`
   For `backend` directory:

   cd ./backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   For `frontend` directory, create a new terminal:
   ```
   cd ./frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Testing

Vitest has been used for testing critical components. To pass all the tests, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `/tests` directory:
   ```
   cd ./tests
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and add these variables:
   ```
   JWT_SECRET = your_JWT_SECRET
   ```
4. Start the backend server (If not already started) inside a new terminal session:
   ```
   cd ../backend
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Run the Tests
